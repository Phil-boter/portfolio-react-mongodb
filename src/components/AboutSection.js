                    I am a junior full stack web developer with a background in
                    foodindustry and automotive service. I began my professional
                    career with an apprenticeship as a brewer, where I
                    subsequently also completed my master's degree at the
                    Technical University of Berlin.
                    <br />
                    After that I worked for the ARWE Group, until then europe's
                    largest company in automotive service, as team leader and
                    later on as quality manager.
                    <br />
                    When the group went bankrupt during the Corona crisis, I was
                    now able to consistently realise my long-held wish for a
                    reorientation. To realise my long-cherished wish I had
                    already gained my first experience of coding at
                    CodeCademy.com and was sure that coding would be my future.{" "}
                    <br />
                    When I was offered the chance to attend a bootcamp at Spiced
                    Academy to become a full stack web developer, I took it.
                    <br />
                    In this intensive 12 week course I dived into the depths of
                    JavaScript. At Spiced Academy I built my first full stack
                    web applications using third party APIs, frontend frameworks
                    like React.js and Vue.js and backend like Express. So please
                    have a look at some of my code on{" "}
