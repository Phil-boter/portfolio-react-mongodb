# react-portfolio

Small portfolio site

## About

React-portfolio is a small portfolio site made with React.js for the clientside,
Node.js/Express for the serverside and mongoDB for the database.

For this site I used react-three-fiber

// https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction //

the first time.
On the one hand for the 3D navigation on desktop devices and on the other hand for the headline-pictures
of each section. So three.js is really fun to use!
Because of not so good performance and useabilty on mobile devices,
I decided to use a classic navigation for small screens.
